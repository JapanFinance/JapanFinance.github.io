## Development

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static website generator. If you do not have Corepack installed, first install it with:

```
npm install -g corepack
```

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service. `yarn serve` is an option for serving it locally.
