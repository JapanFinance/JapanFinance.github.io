This part of rule 2 requires contributions to build on other users\' prior contributions rather than merely disregard or dismiss them. Of course, this doesn\'t mean that users can\'t criticize other users\' comments/posts. But it does mean that such criticism needs to be explained or justified in some way. In practice, the application of this rule will be heavily context-dependent. For example, if one user has posted merely "I love the pension system", then a reply stating "I hate the pension system" wouldn\'t violate rule 2; but if one user has posted a lengthy explanation of certain positive aspects of the pension system, then a reply stating merely "I hate the pension system" ',(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"would")," violate rule 2.")),(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,n.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},"Not sufficiently ",(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"connected to reality"),'. For discussions in the subreddit to be constructive, it is necessary for posts and comments to reflect a base level of respect for some fundamental aspects of the world we live in. For this reason, rule 2 generally prohibits outlandish "conspiracy theory"-type content that promotes or assumes ideas that are so unfounded or unjustifiable as to make constructive discussion impossible. The expectation is that users make sincere efforts to justify fact-based claims by reference to primary sources as much as possible. This doesn\'t mean every claim ever made must be rigorously sourced, of course. But it does mean that persistent refusal to explain or justify an assertion could cause that contribution to violate rule 2.
