## **Buying existing properties**

### Browsing the market

Offers on the market are available to all real estate professionals through a shared database called REINS, for both renting and selling.

Several companies offer tools to search the database, such as [Homes.co.jp](https://www.homes.co.jp/kodate/tokyo/map/) or [Suumo](https://suumo.jp/jj/bukken/ichiran/JJ010FC003/?ar=060&amp;bs=021), by map, train line/station etc.

### Specific market niches

Future new developments and specialty products might need to reach out to specific actors, such as :

- Foreclosed properties are sold through the local courts and are advertised on the official [BIT website](http://bit.sikkou.jp/app/top/pt001/h01/). Blind binding with minimum amounts can be submitted by individuals, and follows a specific process driven by the local court.

- [Hachise co.](https://www.hachise.jp/) sells/rents renovated traditional homes in Kyoto

- [Inaka.net](http://www.inakanet.jp/) specialize in countryside/remote properties

### Identifying a property owner

Records are normally available [source/details needed] but can also [be purchased](https://www1.touki.or.jp/service/index.html)

### Buying Process

### Cost and fees, prices, negotiation

- The MLIT offers a view of market prices via the Land General Information System, an [open database](https://www.land.mlit.go.jp/webland/) in [english](https://www.land.mlit.go.jp/webland_english/servlet/MainServlet) of anonymized, past transactions. However, submission is not mandatory so the data does not fully reflect the market.


- Statistics on prices per areas are [available](https://tochidai.info/), and can be drilled down [by neighborhood](https://tochidai.info/area/ginza1chome/).


- Official assessment of property prices, mostly for tax purposes, can be found at the [National Land Price map](https://www.chikamap.jp/chikamap/Portal), however it must be noted that these differ from actual market prices. 

Note there are [different types of land valuation](https://japanpropertycentral.com/2021/12/how-to-better-understand-the-market-price-of-land/). Also discussed in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/11w89j2/comment/jcx58cn/).

Japan population is dropping sharply and this is why house prices are going down and will go down in most of the country. However, there are places where population is projected to increase, as people are predicted to continue to move into desirable cities with jobs, amenities and growth prospects.

[MLIT has done a very detailed study on this, and one of the reports shows population projections in 2050 with a 1km x 1km granularity](https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001046872.pdf). Those areas projected to increase or remain steady in population probably won't see property values fall too much because there's going to be sustained demand (and they're also likely more desirable areas to live in in the first place.)

### Individual vs corporate ownership

[Interview](https://www.realestate-tokyo.com/news/individual-vs-corporate-investment-property-ownership/) regarding the impact of purchasing real-estate through a corporate structure.


## **Land-specific rules**

Land usage has several restrictions that are usually roughly explained by real estate companies (ex [1](https://japanpropertycentral.com/real-estate-faq/building-regulations-in-japan/) - [2](https://www.realestate-tokyo.com/news/floor-area-ratio-and-building-coverage-ratio/) - [3](https://housekey.jp/japanese-real-estate-coverage-ratios-explained/) ). 

However the specific application to a dedicated land may need to be assessed by a professional builder or architect, as there are numerous rules to account for and some local unique rules.

- Hazard and natural disasters

Maps showing assessed natural disasters such as flooding and earthquake risks are centralized through a [national portal](https://disaportal.gsi.go.jp/). For example choosing [Kyoto](https://disaportal.gsi.go.jp/hazardmap/index.html?citycode=26100) will show the different available map links on the city website, such as [landslide](https://www.bousai.city.kyoto.lg.jp/category/1-2-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html). 

The MLIT has published in 2005 a [Flood Hazard Mapping Manual](https://www.pwri.go.jp/icharm/publication/pdf/2005/flood_hazard_mapping_manual.pdf) in English that has examples.


- Land Zoning

Different categories of zoning limit the usage and density of constructions.

The MLIT offers an [english explanation](https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001050453.pdf) of the key urbanization concepts.

City may have a dedicated page with their zoning maps (can be found by searching for city name and 都市計画図等 : example for [Shibuya](http://www.city.shibuya.tokyo.jp/kankyo/toshi_keikaku/toshi_soudan.html) or [Kyoto](https://www.city.kyoto.lg.jp/menu4/category/55-3-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html) ). Those map normally provide the list of restrictions for each piece of land : max height, type of roof, style etc.

Each land comes with two main restriction, in the form of % called Kenpeiritsu and Yousekiritsu. They limit the ground and interior space of the building, for example 60/100%. 
There will be more restrictions as noted on the city zoning maps, and specific calculations are needed or each land (such as sunlight rules), but those two ratio give a rough idea of how much of a building can be build and how dense the area is going to be.

- Kenpeiritsu [建ぺい率](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%BA%E3%81%BA%E3%81%84%E7%8E%87) is the % of the land that can be built as seen from above, such as 60% : a 100m2 land can support a building taking up to 60m2 of land as seen from above (could be a tower with countless floors).

Kenpeiritsu [source](https://allabout.co.jp/gm/gc/383344/2/) is normally calculated from a bird-view perspective, from the middle point of the external walls structure (external insulation do not count).  Balcony and roof procuring from 1m or less, and temporary structures (such as a car parking roof), and foundations lower than 1 meter, are not counted (roof extending more than 1m : only the part beyond 1m is counted). Further relaxation for corner lot (+10%) or fireproof structure can sometimes be granted depending on local ordinances (limited number of areas and generally only to business properties).

In practice, a rate around 40-60% means there will be small gardens around the houses, and ratio of 60-80% means there will be little green space left once a parking spot and minimum space around the house (50cm or more, also depending on builder) is counted.

- Yousekiritsu [容積率](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AE%B9%E7%A9%8D%E7%8E%87) is interior space of the building compared to the land, such as 100% : a 100m2 land can support a building of 100 m2 interior space.

Yousekiritsu [source](https://allabout.co.jp/gm/gc/383344/2/) does not includes space below a height of 1.4m meters (aka 'kura' storage space, under roofs or stairs for example), garage (with some limitations), basement (with some limitations), terrace (but terrace count for Kenpeiritsu), or elevators. It may be impacted by the size of the nearby road. Note that garage is not necessarily for cars (no minimal size), but needs to have an open access to the road (closable by shutters or simply left open).

In practice houses are often optimized to use the yousekiritsu to improve living space : garage, terrace, and storage space are popular options.

For example, a 100m2 land with 50/80% ratios could be either : 
(1) based on two 40m2 floors (best for insulation), 
or (2) have a 50m2 1F and a 30m2 2F with a 20m2 terrace, 
or (3) have a 50m2 1F including a 20m2 garage, plus a 50m2 2F (total 100m2 garage included)

- Building Envelope and other restrictions

Building height, volume and maximum shape is limited by  [regulation](https://japanpropertycentral.com/real-estate-faq/building-height-restrictions/) and local specific rules (such as [200m height limit near Haneda airport](https://japanpropertycentral.com/real-estate-faq/building-regulations-in-japan/) ), for example to guarantee sunlight rights to nearby properties. 

Land with less than 2m wide access to public road normally [cannot be rebuild](https://japanpropertycentral.com/real-estate-faq/buying-a-house-that-cannot-be-rebuilt/), but can be renovated.

Setback area can be imposed when building if road access is insufficient.

Systems like [OM Solar](https://omsolar.jp/) or [ECS](https://www.kankyosouki.co.jp/) will give you a house that heats itself in winter and to a certain extent cools itself in summer. As well as heating your house from the sun you'll also get free hot water.
They won't build the house for you but put you in touch with contractors in your area that use their system who will work with you to design and build your house.
Using one of these their contractors will also use a good amount of insulation and build a house that will last well. 

### Solar panels

## **Cost &amp; Financing**

The construction prices are generally evaluated by tsubo (3.3 sqm). [Comparison of main makers costs](https://nexer.co.jp/ouchipalette/category/price/).

### Incentives

Various incentives ( [MLIT](https://www.mlit.go.jp/jutakukentiku/house/jutakukentiku_house_fr4_000036.html)  ) are in place as of 2021 to encourage house purchase or remodeling, mainly following the recent consumption tax hike.

### Banks : getting a loan

PR (or spouse of a Japanese national) and stable employment (2+ years) are most important to get a loan. Next comes age, as it becomes difficult to secure long duration loan as you age. Loan amount is mostly impacted by income, typically your current salary, as accumulated assets seems less of a factor.

### Banks : how much can I borrow ?

Income level of the past years is the main factor for the borrow-able amount. Savings seem to be less important.

A basic estimate would be about 7-8 times your income from the past year. 

Online simulators from [Shinsei](https://www.shinseibank.com/powerflex/housing/simulation/) and [MUFG](https://homeloan.bk.mufg.jp/sim/shinki). 
The [AtHome simulator](https://www.athome.co.jp/kariiregaku_simulation/) is capped at 82M. General loan checker [1](https://mogecheck.jp/simulation/borrowing-possibility) or [2](https://0systems.com/score/index.php)can also help get an idea.

### House loan tax deduction

See income tax section for the possibility to reduce your taxes if you have an outstanding home loan.

### Getting funds from parents

See the [Gift Tax wiki](/tax/gift) for the special gift tax exemption for house-purchase purpose.

See the [Inheritance Tax wiki](/inheritance) for the special tax exemption for anticipated inheritance.
