# Big ticket items & hobby

## Price comparison

New electronics : [Kakaku](https://kakaku.com/) is the reference price comparison service, with lists ranging from the usual electronics to vehicle insurance to used camera lens.

It has list of popular item, which is a good way to investigate good deals. For example when assembling a PC, the [recommended parts listed](https://pcpartpicker.com) may be expensive in japan, so you can swap them them local good deals. 

Kaku listings can also used to bargain prices in store.

## New vs used

Reusing good is a great way to reduce the ecological impacts of consumption.

As the locals tend to buy the new and latest models at a premium, take good care of what they own, and put little value in used good they want to get rid off, there is generally a attractive used market from both cost and quality perspective. Sayonara sales can also offer bargains.

This can offer very large savings when settling or moving. 

For example a 5 years old car with 50k km could be half price from new. A five years old high-end washing machine (front loaded with drying) would sell for a third of its new price.

Local recycle shops, or recycle shop chains such are [hard off](https://www.hardoff.co.jp/en/), offer a large choice that can be see in-person.

Online, [yahoo auctions](https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/) and [mercari](https://www.mercari.com/jp/) are popular. [JMTY](https://jmty.jp/) is a popular free advertising option (it does not intermediate between buyers, so scam risk is higher) that can also be used to give objects away for free instead of throwing away still capable goods.
