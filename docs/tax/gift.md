## Exception for the purpose of purchasing a residential home

The "funds for housing acquisition" scheme offers children the ability to receive a one-off tax-free gift of 5-15 million yen from their parent/s or grandparent/s, where the money is spent on the acquisition of residential housing (that the child will live in) shortly after it has been received. Note that it is necessary to file a gift tax return in order to benefit from this scheme.
