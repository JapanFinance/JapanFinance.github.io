**Fair warning the tax is counterintuitive and you likely need to carefully read through the calculation section step by step to correct natural misconceptions :**

Inheritance tax can generate significant concern at first, especially when looking only at the inheritance tax rates and considering the whole estate, but taking the time to understand its mechanics and counter-intuitive calculation shows it is not due in 90% of the cases, only cover certain assets, and actual rates are progressive.

## Who is subject to inheritance tax?

## Inheritance Taxation overview

Japan has a pretty wide inheritance taxation and one might be concerned when first hearing they might be subject to tax both in Japan and abroad. However in practice, only a small portion of estate actually end up paying large inheritance tax due to the deductions and progressive rates. It's worth noting that [only around 9% of all estates are subject to inheritance tax](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/116zspt/comment/j99gdsu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and only around 0.07% of estates are large enough to be subject to an effective tax rate (tax as a proportion of the estate) of more than 25%.

Japan taxation do not apply by default to the total estate, it focuses only on assets in Japan or gifted to people that are relevant from Japan tax perspective, and ignore the rest of the assets. This is described in the first step of Calculation section below. 

People who owe inheritance tax must file an [inheritance tax return](https://www.nta.go.jp/publication/pamph/sozoku/shikata-sozoku2022/index.htm) within 10 months of the relevant death. No declaration is needed if no tax is due.

In case there are debt, or assets than you do not want to manage (such as remote land that you won't find buyer for, but need to pay tax on), you [can refuse the whole inheritance, but must do so quickly](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/z5bi5w/can_mils_debt_fall_to_us/).

Asset ownership changes [at the time of death](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/zng4ff/comment/j0jalpv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), even if the inheritance is only accepted latter. The acquisition value is therefore the one at time of death.

Surviving spouses have [large tax credit](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/102tp6r/comment/j2vc5p1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Basically you find out how much inheritance tax the spouse is theoretically supposed to pay, and then you reduce that bill to the extent that it corresponds to an inheritance valued at less than 160 million yen (or 50% of the estate, whichever is larger).

Japan provides a fairly straightforward foreign tax credit with respect to foreign inheritance taxes imposed on assets located outside Japan. 

Payment of inheritance tax [can be deferred](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/whn62d/comment/ijaga4q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

## Calculation of Inheritance Tax

In [this example](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/z8c2ks/understanding_statutory_heirs_for_inheritance/), a foreign parent passes away in a foreign country, leaving a large estate to two children, one living in Japan and one living in a foreign country. There are therefore two statutory heirs, important to calculate deduction. 

Note that the legal concept of statutory heir is defined by law as close living relatives, and are different from a regular heir, i.e. someone actually receiving money in a will. Determining statutory heirs is usually surviving spouse and children, but can be complex (remarriage, deceased children, adopted children, etc.).

There are three steps to the calculation that have to be done separately :

1/ The first step is calculating the total value of the estate for Japanese inheritance-tax purposes. When the deceased is a foreigner living outside Japan, this will be the value of:

- all assets inherited by the Japan-resident heir (assuming they are an "unlimited taxpayer" for Japanese inheritance tax purposes);

- all assets located in Japan; and

- all assets which were previously subjected to Japan's "early inheritance" system.

Note that this does *not* include all assets of the estate, only the ones subject to Japanese inheritance tax.

Once you know the total value of the estate for Japanese inheritance-tax purposes, you have to subtract the basic deduction (3,000万円, plus 600万円 per statutory heir) and then distribute the remaining value according to the statutory distribution (generally 50% to a surviving spouse, then an equal amount to each surviving children). In our example, that's a 50/50 distribution to the two siblings.

2/ So if the total value of the estate for Japanese income-tax purposes, calculated above, is 1億円, for example, each sibling will be deemed to have received 2,900万円 【(1億円 - 3,000万円 - 2⨉600万円)/2】. The tax liability attributable to each heir is then calculated at inheritance tax rates (see below). In our example, this would generate a deemed tax liability of 385万円 per heir.

3/ Then the crucial final step is to add all the tax liabilities together (770万円 in our example) and distribute them proportionally according to the *actual* distribution of the assets that are subject to Japanese inheritance tax.

In the 1億円 example, the total Japanese inheritance-tax liability is 770万円. If the Japan-resident sibling inherits all assets included in the "total value of the estate", the Japan-resident sibling would be assigned the entire Japanese tax liability, thus they would owe 770万円 on their 1億円 inheritance.  The non-Japanese resident sibling, regardless of what they received, would not be taxed.

Special note: if the actual recipient is not a statutory heir (e.g. is a friend of the deceased, a spouse of a statutory heir, etc.), the final tax burden for that person is increased by 20%.  In our example above, if instead of "Japanese-resident child bequeathed 1億円" it was "Japanese-resident child and their spouse each bequeathed 5,000万円", the tax liability calculated in steps 1 and 2 above would not change, as the spouse is not a statutory heir and therefor not included in those calculations.  However, in step 3, the 770万円 liability would be applied proportionally to the child and their spouse (385万円 each), but the spouse, not being a statutory heir, gets a 20% surcharge, meaning that their final tax is 385万円*1.2 = 462万円. 

### Inheritance Tax Rates.

As described above, an entire estate is not taxed as a lump sum, but rather, tax is calculated on what each statutory heir would in theory receive from that part of the estate subject to Japanese inheritance tax (minus standard deduction), and those taxes are then summed.

As of April 2023, the per-statutory heir tax is as follows:

| Amount | Tax |
| --- | ----------- |
| less than 1,000万円 | 10% |
| less than 3,000万円 | 15% - 50万円 |
| less than 5,000万円 | 20% - 200万円 |
| less than 1億円 | 30% - 700万円 |
| less than 2億円 | 40% - 1,700万円 |
| less than 3億円 | 45% - 2,700万円 |
| less than 6億円 | 50% - 4,200万円 |
| 6億円 or greater | 55% - 7,200万円 |

## Early inheritance system

The "early inheritance" scheme offers an expanded tax-free gift allowance (lifetime allowance of 25 million yen) and beneficial tax rates to children who elect to be taxed on gifts received from their parents at the time of their parent's death. It's a way to effectively tell the tax office, "this is an advance on my inheritance so please tax me as if it was an inheritance, not a gift". Again, it is necessary to file a gift tax return to access this scheme.

## Optimization strategies

There is no "one simple trick" to [avoiding inheritance tax](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/vlev44/inheritance_tax/). Neither trusts nor family companies are especially effective. The most common recommendation is to maximize the use of the tax-free gift allowance to reduce the size of the estate prior to death.

The normal inheritance tax minimization strategies include : take advantage of your annual tax-free gift allowance, receive gifts in excess of the allowance where the resulting tax burden would be lower than if you received the asset at the time of inheritance, use the early inheritance system if the asset you will inherit is expected to increase significantly in value before inheritance occurs, adjust the composition of the estate based on Japanese asset valuation rules (e.g., lower valuations for real estate, especially residential property), take advantage of the special-purpose tax-free gift schemes (gifts for residential housing acquisition, child-raising, educational expenses), etc.

For assets well above the standard deduction (30M+6M per statutory heir), receiving some inheritance when each parent passes instead of waiting for the full inheritance when the last one passes allows to benefit twice from inheritance deduction as well as the progressive nature of inheritance tax rate. Doing the tax calculation for a single inheritance, then for two instead, can show [a significant gap](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/108shs1/complex_qsplease_help_inheriting_a_condo_unit_in/).

Leaving Japan to avoid paying inheritance tax [might be a valid strategy for some](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/z8llcs/asked_the_local_tax_office_about_keeping_pr_while/).
