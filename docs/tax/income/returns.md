# Filing an income tax return

## Who must file

If you are employed, your employer may do a Year-End Tax Adjustment on your behalf to finalize your tax obligation for the year. For many employees, this eliminates the need to file a final tax return. See [this page](https://www.nta.go.jp/english/taxes/individual/12018.htm) for the explanation of wage earners that must file a final tax return.
