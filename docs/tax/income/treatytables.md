# Summary of taxation rights under Japan's tax treaties

This page features a number of tables, summarizing the treaty rules for some common types of income. In particular, these tables are intended to help people living in Japan confirm:

- when they are entitled to avoid double-taxation by preventing a country from taxing them, 
- when they are entitled to alleviate double-taxation by claiming a foreign tax credit, and
- when a foreign tax credit is required, which country will provide them with the credit.

## Explanations and disclaimers

The information in these tables only applies to people who are [tax residents](https://japanfinance.github.io/tax/income/#tax-residency) of Japan.

For the purpose of these tables, "employment income" refers to payments received in exchange for work performed in Japan (i.e., the employee was physically in Japan when the work was performed).

Some of the formatting in the tables was designed for the GitHub version of this wiki. If you are reading this on the Reddit version, click [here](https://japanfinance.github.io/tax/income/treatytables) for the GitHub version.

The information provided below is intended as a summary. Tax treaties contain exceptions and the tables should not be used as substitutes for reading the text of any relevant treaty. The tables were prepared in May 2024.

## United States

Applying the [US-Japan tax treaty (PDF)](https://www.mof.go.jp/tax_policy/summary/international/tax_convention/USA_ST_en.pdf) is more complicated than applying other treaties, due to the saving clause in Article 1(4). The saving clause means that the treaty rules are different depending on whether the Japan-resident taxpayer is a US citizen. Tables for both scenarios are provided below.

### Non-US citizen

[^usgpfn]: The US has sole taxation rights with respect to US government pensions (excluding social security) unless the recipient holds Japanese citizenship. Thus, people who hold both US and Japanese citizenship will be subject to tax in both countries and must claim a FTC in the US.

[^irafn]: The Japanese tax treatment of US tax-advantaged retirement schemes is somewhat unresolved, as discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/zlaiqx/us_ira_reporting_obligations_in_japan/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/m4vpfx/most_definitive_answer_on_401kira_treatment_as/). But at this stage Article 17 seems the most likely to apply.
