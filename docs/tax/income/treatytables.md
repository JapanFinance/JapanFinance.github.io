# Summary of taxation rights under Japan's tax treaties

This page features tables summarizing the treaty rules for some common types of income. In particular, these tables are intended to help people living in Japan confirm:

- when they are entitled to avoid double-taxation by preventing a country from taxing them; 
- when they are entitled to alleviate double-taxation by claiming a foreign tax credit; and
- when a foreign tax credit is required, which country must provide them with the credit.

## Explanations and disclaimers

The information in these tables only applies to people who are [tax residents](https://japanfinance.github.io/tax/income/#tax-residency) of Japan.

For the purpose of these tables, "employment income" refers to payments received in exchange for work performed in Japan (i.e., the employee was physically in Japan when the work was performed).

Also, for the purpose of these tables, the rules for dividends and capital gains derived from the sale of shares are generally limited to shares that do not derive the majority of their value from real estate held by the company. Shares in real estate holding companies (REITs, etc.) are typically subject to different rulesâ€”check the relevant treaty for details.

It's important to note that treaties don't *require* countries to tax income merely because they have the right to tax it. Accordingly, the fact that a country has the right to tax particular income under a treaty (as shown in the tables below) does not imply that the country taxes that income.

Some of the formatting in the tables was designed for the GitHub version of this wiki. If you are reading this on the Reddit version, click [here](https://japanfinance.github.io/tax/income/treatytables) for the GitHub version.

The information provided below is intended as a summary. Tax treaties contain exceptions and the tables should not be used as substitutes for reading the text of any relevant treaty. The tables were prepared in May 2024.

## United States

Applying the [US-Japan tax treaty (PDF)](https://www.mof.go.jp/tax_policy/summary/international/tax_convention/USA_ST_en.pdf) is more complicated than applying other treaties, due to the saving clause in Article 1(4). The saving clause means that the treaty rules are different depending on whether the Japan-resident taxpayer is a US citizen. Tables for both scenarios are provided below.

### Non-US citizen

## Canada

The current Canada-Japan tax treaty is available as a PDF [here](https://www.mof.go.jp/tax_policy/summary/international/tax_convention/191018canada_e.pdf). Note that the Canada-Japan treaty is quite outdated compared to many of Japan's other treaties, and does not comply to current OECD standards. It also lacks any clauses dealing with pensions or annuities.

[^gpfn]: Japan has sole taxation rights if the recipient is a Japanese citizen.

[^usgpfn]: The US has sole taxation rights with respect to US government pensions (excluding social security) unless the recipient holds Japanese citizenship. Thus, people who hold both US and Japanese citizenship will be subject to tax in both countries and must claim a FTC in the US.

[^irafn]: The Japanese tax treatment of US tax-advantaged retirement schemes is somewhat unresolved, as discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/zlaiqx/us_ira_reporting_obligations_in_japan/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/m4vpfx/most_definitive_answer_on_401kira_treatment_as/). But at this stage Article 17 seems the most likely to apply.
