# Asset Reporting

Separate from filings for income/gifts/inheritance, there are some reports that need to be filed about your assets if you meet the requirements.

## Report of Foreign Assets (RFA or OAR)

This report was also formerly often translated as Overseas Asset Report (OAR) in material published by accounting firms.

## Report of Assets and Liabilities (ALR)

Official NTA English material refers to this as the Report of Assets and Liabilities, but documents published by accounting firms often called it the Assets and Liabilities Report, hence the acronym ALR.
