# Asset Reporting

Separate from filings for income/gifts/inheritance, there are some reports that need to be filed about your assets if you meet the requirements.

## Report of Foreign Assets

### Official name

In Japanese, it is 国外財産調書. This report was also formerly often translated as Overseas Asset Report (OAR) in material published by accounting firms. The NTA's English translation is, however, Report of Foreign Assets (RFA).

The deadline to file is the last day of June (if this is a weekend, then the following Monday).

### Outline

The RFA is an obligation to declare assets located outside of Japan for [tax residents](https://japanfinance.github.io/tax/income/#tax-residency) (other than [non-permanent tax residents](https://japanfinance.github.io/tax/income/#non-permanent-tax-residents)), if they have a value of 50 million yen or more, as of December 31st of the previous year.

### Who needs to file

[Tax residents](https://japanfinance.github.io/tax/income/#tax-residency) (other than [non-permanent tax residents](https://japanfinance.github.io/tax/income/#non-permanent-tax-residents)) whose overseas assets have a market value of JPY 50 million or more on December 31st of the previous year (regardless of whether the individual is required to file a tax return).

### Tax and cost

The obligation to file does not generate specific tax or submission costs.

### Penalties for failure to file

Please note that if the relevant foreign country exchange financial data with Japan, the NTA likely already have access to your foreign financial accounts. This is part of automated exchange under the [CRS program (pdf)](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/kokusai/crs/pdf/02en.pdf). CRS does not include other type of assets (material, real estate) that are in the scope of OAR.

In addition, penalties for failure are :

According to [the statute](https://elaws.e-gov.go.jp/document?lawid=409AC0000000110#Mp-At_10):

> 正当な理由がなくて国外財産調書をその提出期限までに税務署長に提出しなかったときは、その違反行為をした者は、一年以下の懲役又は五十万円以下の罰金に処する。ただし、情状により、その刑を免除することができる.

In other words, the penalty for not filing "without good justification" is up to one year imprisonment or a fine of up to 500,000 yen. However, the statute explicitly allows for the penalty to be waived. In practice, I expect penalties are very unlikely to be imposed in cases where the taxpayer clearly wasn't aware of their obligation or just forgot to file it, etc. Penalties are most likely reserved for cases where (1) the taxpayer clearly had the intention to evade tax by hiding assets and/or (2) the NTA repeatedly asked the taxpayer to file the report and the taxpayer repeatedly refused to file it.

### Valuation

Values must be declared as of December 31st of the previous year. Market values at that date should be used.

### Submission

You can [use the e-tax desktop software, use commercial software](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/1arcnpm/how_do_you_create_overseas_asset_report_via_etax/), or fill out the PDF on the NTA page and drop or mail the paper to your tax office.

## Report of Assets and Liabilities

### Official name

In Japanese, it is 財産債務調書. Official NTA English material refers to this as the Report of Assets and Liabilities, but documents published by accounting firms have often called it the Assets and Liabilities Report (ALR).
