# Bicycle Insurance

Bicycle insurance has become mandatory in an increasing number of prefectures in Japan.
This shift has been driven by several high-profile cases, with damages reaching up to 90 million JPY, raising awareness about the importance of coverage.

[Traffic Safety Mark (ＴＳマーク) (JP)](https://www.tmt.or.jp/safety/index2.html) serves as a form of vehicle insurance for bicycles, similar to car insurance. Unlike standard Japanese bicycle insurance, which is tied to individuals, the Traffic Safety Mark is linked to a specific bicycle, ensuring coverage irrespective of who is riding it.

To obtain a Traffic Safety Mark, have your bicycle serviced by a certified Bicycle Safety Mechanic (自転車安全整備士) at a bicycle shop.
The mechanic will affix a sticker to your bicycle as proof of service and insurance, which is valid for one year from the date of service.
