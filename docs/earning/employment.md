Various job posting sites and headhunters publish salary guides.

## Housing

- Relocation (for work purposes) allowances are not taxable

- Housing allowance, an amount paid along with salary, is taxable. Since the company can choose to remove this allowance, it is less secure and flexible than pure salary while being taxed in the same way.

- Company housing, where the company rents the housing and the employee pays back a part of it, is non-taxable (except the part being paid back). This is usually financially attractive.


## Home leave

Please refer to the [Income Tax page](/tax/income) for details. An air ticket per year, direct to (spouse's) home country, for a foreign employee and family, may be non-taxable


## Retirement allowance

Please refer to the [Income Tax page](/tax/income) for details. Based on number of years of service, a retirement allowance (paid to an employee when leaving the company) can be tax free up to a point.
