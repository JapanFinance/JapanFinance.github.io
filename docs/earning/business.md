## Consumption tax and the invoice system

The Invoice System Questions Thread is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/128iwv8/invoice_system_questions_thread_april_2023/). A rough translation of the NTA's FAQs is available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/wiki/edit/index/earning/business/invoices).

## Depreciation of assets

The "useful life" figures that are used to calculate amortization/depreciation periods come from 
[these regulations](https://elaws.e-gov.go.jp/document?lawid=340M50000040015). The list is quite badly presented within the actual regulations, though. It's presented a little better at the NTA's site [here](https://www.keisan.nta.go.jp/r2yokuaru/aoiroshinkoku/hitsuyokeihi/genkashokyakuhi/taiyonensuhyo.html), and the presentation at [this site](https://www.japanex.jp/zenryoku_stock_lives) is more user friendly, but that's not an official source.
