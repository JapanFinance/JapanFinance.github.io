# Name yourself wisely

Before moving to Japan, try to get your COE issued with the shortest possible legal version of your name.  Ideally, first and last only, no middle name(s), no hyphens, and as short in character count as possible

* If you have multiple passports, pick the one with the most compact name.  A slightly longer name is better than a middle name.
* Consider changing your legal name to a short one and have your passport re-issued
* Some countries (e.g. the UK) will allow you to reissue you passport without middle names without having to legally change your names.

# If that fails...

You can try to avail your municipality for a legal alias.
