This page is inspired from r/povertyfinance, and is about making the most out of little money, which can be by choice, or circumstances in one's life - hopefully temporary.

However the information listed here should be specific to Japan.

## Food

Supermarkets and combinis often discount products at the end of the day, usually from 10% to 50%. This is market by stickers with a number between 1 and 5.

For vegetables, it is often cheaper to look for a local greengrocer (八百屋) than buying them at the supermarket. YMMV but they often sell vegetables and fruit that are slightly misshapen and do not qualify for the supermarket.

Some education institutions, such as public universities, have canteens open to the public, and usually offer a healthy balanced meal ([provider example](https://gakushoku.coop/)) for [a few hundred yens](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/oas66i/weekly_offtopic_thread_30_june_2021/h3jmdln?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

There are some [food bank](https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/umemgq/emergency_food_services/) associations.
