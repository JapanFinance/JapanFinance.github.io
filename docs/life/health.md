## Health

Under social security there are limits on the maximum out-of pocket you may have per month, based on income (source needed). 

Medical Expenses beyond 100kJPY/year can be deduced from taxable income, see [Income Tax wiki page](tax/income/#wiki_deduction_for_medical_expenses_above_100kjpy.2Fyear).

Some cities or prefecture cover children health expenses fully (no out-of-pocket) (source needed).
