# US-specific information

## Passive foreign investment company (PFIC)

If you are a US taxpayer, you should be aware of the [IRS concept of PFICs](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8621), and in general, avoid investing in them. See [the instructions](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8621) for form 8621, which describes the punitive filing requirements and taxation. Japan-domiciled investment funds are all PFICs, including but not limited to:

* Japanese mutual funds
* Japanese ETFs
* Japan Real Estate Investment Trusts (J-REIT)

An individual company may also meet the definition of a PFIC, so care needs to be taken when investing in Japanese companies.

Accounts tax-favored in Japan such as NISA and iDeCo do not shield US taxpayers from PFIC filing requirements or taxation imposed by the US. Therefore, US taxpayers can generally only park cash in iDeCo or buy individual (non-PFIC) Japanese company stock in a regular NISA account to get any tax benefit while avoiding PFICs.

## US-Japan tax treaty

All the treaty documentation is available in English from the IRS's website [here](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/japan-tax-treaty-documents).

Note that the "technical explanations" bring a lot of clarity to the practical meaning of the text. Note also that articles 10, 11, 13, 15, 20, 23, and 25â€“27 of the current treaty (2003) were amended by the 2013 protocol, which took effect in 2019.

Documents relating to the US's other tax treaties are available [here](https://www.irs.gov/downloads/irs-trty).

## IRS resources

The key document for nonresidents is [Publication 54](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p54), *Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad*.

Many US nationals are also required to file an FBAR annually. The IRS's FBAR information page is [here](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar). [This page](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/comparison-of-form-8938-and-fbar-requirements), comparing Form 8938 to the FBAR, also provides a useful summary of US taxpayers' obligations.

## Pension and social security

The SSA's information page about the US's pension totalization agreement with Japan is [here](https://www.ssa.gov/international/Agreement_Pamphlets/japan.html). The US embassy in Japan also has a page [here](https://jp.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/social-security/totalization-agreement/) describing how to claim US benefits under the agreement.

## How to file a US Tax Return as a resident of Japan

## Summary by u/univworker for future reference:

&gt; You have to file federal taxes every year. You probably won't pay taxes though, because you can either use the [Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-earned-income-exclusion) or Foreign Tax Credit (FTC).

&gt; If you are using FEIE, you can exclude $107,600 (filing by yourself) but you are not eligible to contribute to an IRA or roth IRA, because your income is subtracted from your AGI.

&gt; If you elect to use the FTC, then you cannot easily return to using FEIE. In this case, you deduct the taxes you paid to Japan from your us tax bill.

&gt; You really don't want to deal with FORM 8621 for PFIC, because it's onerous, taxes you punitively, and leaves your taxes unfiled if you screw up (meaning no SOL).

&gt; IDECO for Americans is PFIC except for the park it in cash option

&gt; Japanese wrapper funds are PFIC.
