## French-Japanese convention

In place since 1995, a [fiscal convention between France and Japan](https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/files/media/10_conventions/japon/japon-convention-cml.pdf) eases some of the dual taxation issues. As of 2021-05, the last update is from 2007. 

See article 2 for the scope of the convention. Note this convention does not covers gift or inheritances, so there is a risk of double taxation.
