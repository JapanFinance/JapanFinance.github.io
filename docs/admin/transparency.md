# Moderation Transparency

## Periodic Reports

Every January we will post an annual report, summarizing the activities of the moderators and the most significant events over the previous year.

These reports will be posted as **unlocked** threads where users will be free to comment, ask questions, and make suggestions. The mods will endeavor to respond to all comments received regarding the moderation of the sub, though where necessary, priority will be given to comments made by users who are regular contributors.

## Public Modlogs

We are using the u/publicmodlogs bot to automatically publish this subreddit's moderation log in real-time.

You can view the log at the following URLs:

* JSON: https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/about/log/.json?feed=7e9b27126097f51ae6c9cd5b049af34891da6ba6&user=publicmodlogs
* XML: https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/about/log/.rss?feed=7e9b27126097f51ae6c9cd5b049af34891da6ba6&user=publicmodlogs

**We believe that only the most-recent 5,000 log entries are archived at those addresses. If you are interested in having a record of the entire log, you will need to maintain your own archive.**

### Options

It is also possible to view the data in a filtered form, using any of the tags available when viewing the normal moderation log page. For example:

* Add "&type=removelink" to the link to see removed items
* Add "&limit=NNNN" where NNNN is a number to see more entries
