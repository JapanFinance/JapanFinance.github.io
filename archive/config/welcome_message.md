You've figured out how to sort your garbage and buy a commuter pass. You've opened a bank account and got yourself a phone. You've mastered katakana and memorized almost 50 kanji. But now you're wondering: *Which credit card should I apply for? Which cashless payment system should I be using? Do I need to file a tax return? What's the cheapest way to send money overseas?*

You're starting to suspect that you might never leave Japan. You're in a long-term relationship and thinking about buying an apartment. You've memorized almost 500 kanji. But now you're wondering: *Will the national pension be enough to live on? What's an iDeCo? Do I need life insurance? Should I be worried about inheritance tax?*

**Welcome!** This subreddit exists to crowdsource high-quality answers to these questions and many more.

### Scope

On the "finance" side, we cover everything from budgeting tips to retirement planning. On the "tech" side, we tend to focus on topics that have a financial aspect to them (fintech, cryptocurrency, payment processing, renewable energy, etc.), but general discussions of productivity/lifestyle tech (cell phones, apps, home automation, electric vehicles, etc.) are also welcome. For everything else, we have a weekly "off-topic" thread, where users can ask and answer questions that don't quite fit within the "finance and tech" theme.

### Wiki

Our [wiki](https://japanfinance.github.io/) is fast becoming a comprehensive and trusted repository of Japan-related personal finance information. Please take a look at what we've put together so far, and become a contributor if you have something to add!
